# 📦 Onboard SDK

>[!Note]
> **EDUCATIONAL PROJECT DISCLAIMER**

>This project is developed purely for **educational and demonstrative purposes**. While it aims to provide useful public transport information for Milan, it relies on data sources, including scraping information from `giromilano.atm.it`.
>
>**The terms of service for ATM (Azienda Trasporti Milanesi) regarding data usage are not explicitly clear, and this project may potentially violate them.**
>
>Therefore:
>- **Use at Your Own Risk:** We do not guarantee the accuracy or continued availability of the data, nor do we assume responsibility for any consequences arising from its use.
>- **Unscheduled Discontinuation:** This project, or parts of it, may be taken down or become non-functional unexpectedly if ATM's policies change or if the data sources become inaccessible.

>We advise caution and understanding of these limitations.

The **Onboard SDK** is a Dart package designed to facilitate seamless interaction with the [Onboard Project server](https://github.com/onboard-project/server) API. It provides a set of data models (Dart classes) and helper methods to consume the server's JSON responses, making it easy for the [Onboard Client](https://github.com/onboard-project/client) (or any other Dart application) to work with public transport data.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Type-Safe Data Models:** Converts raw JSON data from the server into strongly-typed Dart objects (e.g., `Stop`, `Line`, `WaitingTime`).
*   **Easy API Interaction:** Provides convenient methods to fetch data from various Onboard server endpoints.
*   **Reduced Boilerplate:** Abstracts away JSON parsing and HTTP request handling, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
*   **Testable & Maintainable:** Designed with best practices to ensure code quality and ease of maintenance.
